# ft_containers
![Project illustration](./illustration.png "Storing, storing...")<br>
This project is the 13th of the 42 School cursus.<br>

# Description
In this project, we must reimplement some of the STL containers, defined by the ISO 1998.<br>
Those containers are :<br>
 - vector<br>
 - stack (underlying our own vector)<br>
 - map<br>
 - set<br>

In addition to this, some extra features and utilities are expected to be reimplemented, as:<br>
 - iterator_traits<br>
 - reverse_iterator<br>
 - enable_if<br>
 - is_integral<br>
 - equal<br>
 - lexicographical_compare<br>
 - pair<br>
 - make_pair<br>
